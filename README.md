# Social Network API

## Description
This is a social networking API that allows user's to create an account, share their thoughts, and react to other peoples thoughts. You can even add and delete different friends!<br> It uses `express.js`, `MangoDB`, `Mongoose`, and `Moment`. It all comes together to make this wonderful and easy to use backend.<br>

## Installation
To install this to a local device, first will want to clone this repo on your computer. After it is cloned, go to the `package.json` file, right-click on it and open up `integrated terminal`. Once in here type <strong>"npm i"</strong>. Once all the packages are installed, you are ready to go! Now in the terminal type in <strong>"npm start"</strong>. This will start the server. Once the server has been started you can use `Insomnia` or a similar application to try it out!

## Routes/Testing
To develop this application I used `Insomnia` to test the different routes to see if they were working properly. Below I will list the different routes that there are:<br>
<br>

    - <strong>GET ALL</strong> User's: `GET /api/users`<br>
